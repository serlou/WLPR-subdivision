# WLPR-subdivision
MATLAB implementation of Weigthed Local Polynomial Regression subdivision schemes.

This a MATLAB R2022a implementation of the subdivision schemes, for periodic noisy data, studied in:

López-Ureña, S., & Yáñez, D. F. (2024). Subdivision Schemes Based on Weighted Local Polynomial Regression: A New Technique for the Convergence Analysis. Journal of Scientific Computing, 100(1), 1-44. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-024-02573-7

Subdivision schemes are an efficient tool to generate curves from a sample of points. These particular schemes were designed to deal with noisy data.
